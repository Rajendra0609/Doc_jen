# This file designates code owners for this repository.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more GitHub usernames or teams.

# Example: set Rajendra0609 as the code owner for everything in the repository
*       @Rajendra0609

# To add more co-owners, add their GitHub usernames separated by spaces:
# *       @Rajendra0609 @chowdary1997
# To specify owners for specific paths, use the pattern:
# /Dockerfile/  @Rajendra0609 @chowdary1997
